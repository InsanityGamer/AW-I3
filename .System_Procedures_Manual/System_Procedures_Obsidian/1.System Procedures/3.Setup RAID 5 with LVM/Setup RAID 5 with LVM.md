RAID-5 is a thee preferred Redundancy and Contingency solution for storage and backup. Specifically RAID stands for "Redundant Array of Independent Disks".

LVM is a method of Virtualizing Storage. "Logical Volume Management" links your storage devices into 1 logical drive.
For example, in LVM we can link four 32GB USB storage devices into two logical 64GB drives. Then, using RAID-1 we could mirror the primary LVM drive onto the secondary LVM drive.

This would be an example of RAID-10 (AKA RAID 1+0). 

The [[raid 5 in a virtual machine]] is a system procedure meant to demo the practical application of RAID5.
